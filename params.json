The standard logon action will create a new view (PersonaLogon instead of LogOn) informing the visitors that your site is using Mozilla Persona Sign In with some information links to Mozilla site.\r\nTheme builders can override this view by copying the PersonaLogon.cshtml file from the module/views folder to their Theme views folder and changing it according their needs.\r\n\r\nThis module comes also with a widget you can put on your site (e.g. Navigation Zone, after your menu) to have a Persona Sign In button at the right side of your menu. If the user logins, the Widget changes to a logout button).\r\nTheme builders can override the widget by copying the Parts.Persona.SignIn.cshtml view to their theme views folder.\r\nCheck persona.css to change positioning and colors according to your theme needs.\r\n\r\nPersona settings\r\n================\r\n\r\nAt this initial version you can only change the Remember Authenticated Users setting to have your site keep cookies of the authenticated users right after their sign in.\r\n\r\nYou should also set Admin->Settinggs->Users setting 'Users can create new accounts on this site' to true if you want to automatically create new users when they sign in with Persona\r\n\r\nAdministrator Validation\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThe module keeps checking the validated administrator on every action and if any of the following happens it falls back to standard Orchard Sign In:<br>\r\nValidated Administrator no longer exists<br>\r\nValidated Administrator email changes<br>\r\nModule Settings no longer exist<br>\r\nValidated Administrator is no longer an Administrator<br>\r\n\r\nNext version\r\n============\r\n\r\nJavascript functions as a jQuery plugin to be able to pass settings like Sign In and Sign Out button classes<br>\r\nNew setting to be able to change the default Persona e-mail validator. By default it uses https://verifier.login.persona.org/verify<br>\r\nMore Persona Sign In button themes out of the box<br>\r\n\r\nAny questions or queries, please feel free to tweet me @fotisgpap, fork and improve!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
